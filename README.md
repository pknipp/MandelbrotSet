## Mandelbrot set

This app was built from [Heroku's scala starter](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-scala).

TO DO:
- Error handling for bad urls.
- Julia sets.
- Use local storage for successive increases of maxIter.
- Use better means of determining whether or not sequence will diverge.
- Determine why Heroku crashes.
- Use scala to format numbers in E-notation.
- Return results in json.
